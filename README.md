# VolunTrack

Application connecting volunteers and organizers of volunteering events. 
Backend uses Firebase Realtime Database and Node.js. Front End uses React Native. 
Project Created for HackGT 9.


Our application streamlines the volunteer process from start to finish. We allow a user to both volunteer and organize events. 
We use QR code technology to automatically track attendance and checked in/out users. All a user has to do is scan in and out, nothing else needed. 
Using this information, we show various metrics about events, including past events that the user volunteered for or organized. 
In addition, we have a volunteer hub; this uses geolocation to find events in the area, as well as connect the user to various volunteers/organizers.
